Installation (virtualbox, w/ shared folders)
============================================

- Download VirtualBox and install a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server image 
  (http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ubuntu-12.04.2-server-amd64.iso)
  
- If you have trouble connecting to the Internet from the VBox guest, try
  `VBoxManage modifyvm <name of vm> --natdnshostresolver1 on` from the command
  line.

- Make sure you have the smogon-redux repo checked out locally. Then, go to
  Devices > Shared Folders and add the repo's directory. Make sure the folder
  name field is "smogon".

- Setup port forwarding so we can access SSH and the web server from outside the
  VM. Devices > Network Adapters, map guest port 22 to some host IP (I use 2222)
  and map guest port 80 to some host IP (I use 2280). Now you can ssh into the
  box using `ssh localhost -p 2222` and access the webserver via
  `localhost:2280`.

- Now, run the Smogon virtualbox bootstrap script:
  sudo sh -c 'curl -L https://raw.github.com/monsanto/smogon-redux/master/bin/bootstrap-virtualbox | sh'

- Run the setup script: `sudo /smogon/bin/smogon-setup`

- Reboot: `sudo reboot`
  (Yes, this step is necessary as the setup script modifies /etc/environment)

Installation (Git)
==================

- Run the Smogon Git bootstrap script:
  sudo sh -c 'curl -L https://raw.github.com/monsanto/smogon-redux/master/bin/bootstrap-git | sh'

- Run the setup script: `sudo /smogon/bin/smogon-setup`

- Reboot: `sudo reboot`
  (Yes, this step is necessary as the setup script modifies /etc/environment)
